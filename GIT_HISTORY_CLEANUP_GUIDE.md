# Git History Cleanup Guide - Remove Exposed Secrets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Repository Status

**Remote Repository**: https://github.com/JulioMCruz/Self-x402.git
**Commits**: 1 commit (2b1dedf "self x402 initial")
**Exposed Data Found**:
- Hardhat test private key in `Vendors/Places-x402-Api/test-x402-payment.ts`
- Mock API key in `Selfx402App/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Risk Level**: **LOW** (These are test/demo keys, not production secrets)
- Hardhat key: Publicly known default test key #1
- API key: Truncated mock data "sk_live_abc123...xyz789"

---

## Option 1: Force Push Clean History (RECOMMENDED)

**When to use**: Early in development, few collaborators, want clean history

**Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Stage the security fixes
git add Selfx402App/app/dashboard/page.tsx
git add Vendors/Places-x402-Api/test-x402-payment.ts
git add .gitignore
git add LICENSE

# 2. Amend the initial commit (rewrite history)
git commit --amend -m "Initial commit - Selfx402 marketplace platform

- Selfx402 marketplace app (Next.js)
- Vendor API example (Places-x402-Api)
- Payment facilitator (Selfx402Facilitator)
- Complete documentation (README, PRD, prompts)
- MIT License
- Security: All sensitive data in .env files"

# 3. Force push to GitHub (‚ö†Ô∏è REWRITES PUBLIC HISTORY)
git push origin main --force

# 4. Verify on GitHub that old commit is gone
# Visit: https://github.com/JulioMCruz/Self-x402/commits/main
```

**Pros**:
- Clean history with no exposed secrets
- Single clean commit
- No trace of test keys in history

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rewrites public history (collaborators need to re-clone)
- GitHub may still cache old commit for ~24 hours
- Anyone who already cloned needs to force pull

---

## Option 2: Add Security Commit (SAFER, KEEPS HISTORY)

**When to use**: Multiple collaborators, want to preserve history, low-risk secrets

**Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Stage the security fixes
git add Selfx402App/app/dashboard/page.tsx
git add Vendors/Places-x402-Api/test-x402-payment.ts
git add .gitignore
git add LICENSE

# 2. Commit with clear security message
git commit -m "Security: Remove hardcoded test keys, add .gitignore

- Use environment variables for test private key (Hardhat default fallback)
- Clarify mock API key in dashboard is demo data
- Add comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files
- Add MIT License

Note: Previous commit contained Hardhat's publicly-known test key #1
and truncated mock API key - both safe for demonstration purposes."

# 3. Push normally
git push origin main
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No history rewrite
- ‚úÖ Safe for collaborators
- ‚úÖ Clear audit trail of security fix

**Cons**:
- Old commit still contains test keys in GitHub history
- Anyone with old commit hash can still view it

## Option 3: GitHub Secret Scanning (NUCLEAR OPTION)

**When to use**: Production secrets exposed, need GitHub to purge cache

**Steps**:

1. **Contact GitHub Support**:
   - Go to: https://support.github.com/
   - Request: "Purge cached commit with exposed secrets"
   - Provide: Repository URL, commit hash `2b1dedf`

2. **Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner** (advanced):
   ```bash
   # Install BFG
   brew install bfg  # macOS

   # Clone fresh copy
   git clone --mirror https://github.com/JulioMCruz/Self-x402.git

   # Remove the exposed key from ALL history
   cd Self-x402.git
   echo "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" > ../secrets.txt
   bfg --replace-text ../secrets.txt

   # Force push cleaned history
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   git push --force
   ```

**Use only if**: Real production keys were exposed

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Step 1: Assess Risk ‚úÖ DONE

**Finding**: Low risk
- Hardhat key: Public test key (Hardhat's default account #1)
- API key: Clearly fake/truncated mock data

**Decision**: No urgent security risk, but clean for best practices

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

**Recommendation**: **Option 1** (Force Push Clean History)

**Reasoning**:
- Only 1 commit to rewrite
- Early in development
- Clean slate is best practice
- Test keys are public knowledge anyway

### Step 3: Execute Cleanup

```bash
# Run Option 1 commands above
git add -A
git commit --amend -m "Initial commit - Selfx402 marketplace platform..."
git push origin main --force
```

### Step 4: Verify Cleanup

```bash
# Check current HEAD
git log --oneline

# Verify files fixed
git show HEAD:Selfx402App/app/dashboard/page.tsx | grep "sk_live"
git show HEAD:Vendors/Places-x402-Api/test-x402-payment.ts | grep "TEST_PRIVATE_KEY"

# Both should show the fixed versions with comments
```

### Step 5: Notify Collaborators (if any)

Send message:
```
I rewrote the initial commit to remove test keys from history.
Please re-clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/JulioMCruz/Self-x402.git

Old local repos will conflict - fresh clone recommended.
```

## Future Prevention

### Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent committing files with secrets

# Check for common secret patterns
if git diff --cached | grep -E "(PRIVATE_KEY.*=.*0x[a-fA-F0-9]{64}|sk_live_[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,})"; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Potential secret detected in staged changes!"
    echo "Please use environment variables instead."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### GitHub Secret Scanning

Enable in repository settings:
1. Go to: https://github.com/JulioMCruz/Self-x402/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable: "Secret scanning"
3. Enable: "Push protection"

### Environment Variable Checklist

Before every commit, verify:
- ‚úÖ No `.env` files staged (except `.env.example`)
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded keys in code files
- ‚úÖ All secrets referenced via `process.env.XXX`
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` includes all sensitive patterns

## Summary

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Security fixes completed locally
**Git Status**: üü° Changes not yet committed
**Remote Status**: üî¥ Old commit with test keys still on GitHub

**Next Step**: Choose and execute Option 1, 2, or 3 above

**Recommendation**: **Execute Option 1** for clean history

## Questions?

- **Q**: Are the exposed keys dangerous?
  - **A**: No. Hardhat test key is publicly documented. Mock API key is fake/truncated.

- **Q**: Will GitHub remember the old commit?
  - **A**: For ~24 hours in cache, then purged if no references exist.

- **Q**: What if someone already cloned?
  - **A**: They'll need to re-clone after force push.

- **Q**: Should I rotate any real keys?
  - **A**: No real keys were exposed. Test/demo keys only.
